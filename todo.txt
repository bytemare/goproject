- makefile : call commands inside other commands

- Sonar : fix travis

- change naming convention :
instead of naming the used profile 'default profile', say 'active profile'

- dont put own creds into default profile template, but use 'newProfile' with dummy values

- add a side tool, an other binary, to generate new template files from a template template

- pre-commit/push hook to test semver

- testing :
    - first fuzz : oss-fuzz; go-fuzz, fuzzit
    - then make tests with : github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo

- CI conf linters :
    - travis, appveyor, circleci


DOC :

if you already have a project created, say on GitHub, you may want to git clone it, cd into it, and simply make a
goproject new
this will create the files and layout for a project based on the directory you are in


- README template
cf golangci-lint to generate the readme with values like latest release version, changelog, etc.

- acknowledge race condition between checking if a file already exists and its creation, check if go has a mechanism for that


# Add some explanations on readme
    - basics
    - contributing for new file templates

# 5. Versioning and releasing
- lock versions of tools and dependencies

# 4. Auto updates
    - automatic upgrades




# 3. Add tooling
 - enrich with options and tooling


# 4. Docker
- include docker in makefile
- include k8 in makefile
- install go2seccomp
- verify if we can integrate security profiles (seccomp, apparmor, ...) into the container, and run
     them with the entrypoint : ENTRYPOINT ["seccomp="..." apparmor="..." /bin/goproject"]


- run tests inside docker if docker is available



# 7. Other enhancements
    - verify if using upx is safe : test and try to make it fail (with a fuzzer ?)

     - enforce vanity URLs for the package

     - https://github.com/ntpsec/ntpsec

     - set proxy/redirect so code can be pulled with bytema.re/goproject, go.bytema.re, bytema.re/go
